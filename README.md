## 1. Problem Definition
Binary Classification
> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

## 2. Data


The original data came from the [Cleveland database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Howevever, we've downloaded it in a formatted way from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci/).

The original database contains 76 attributes, but here only 14 attributes will be used. **Attributes** (also called **features**) are the variables what we'll use to predict our **target variable**.

Attributes and features are also referred to as **independent variables** and a target variable can be referred to as a **dependent variable**.

> We use the independent variables to predict our dependent variable.

Or in our case, the independent variables are a patients different medical attributes and the dependent variable is whether or not they have heart disease.

## 3. Evaluation

> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursure this project.


However, due to the nature of experimentation, the evaluation metric may change over time.

## 4. Features

Features are different parts of the data. During this step, you'll want to start finding out what you can about the data.
